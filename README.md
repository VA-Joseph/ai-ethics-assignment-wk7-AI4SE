# Week 7 Assignment – AI Ethics  
**Course:** AI for Software Engineering  
**Theme:** *Designing Responsible and Fair AI Systems* 🌍⚖️

This repository contains all materials and deliverables for **Week 7** of the *AI for Software Engineering* course. The assignment focuses on applying ethical principles to AI systems, identifying and mitigating algorithmic bias, and auditing models using industry-grade fairness tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Define key AI ethics concepts such as algorithmic bias, transparency, and accountability.
- Analyze real-world case studies (e.g., hiring algorithms, facial recognition systems).
- Perform fairness audits using the COMPAS dataset and visualize bias metrics.
- Reflect on responsible AI practices in personal and professional projects.
